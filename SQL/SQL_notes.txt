We are using a relation database management system called PostgresSQL or ust Postgres

a relational database is made of many tables that are linked
Need to specify data type in table column ([Int, decimal, precision], [Varchar, text], boolean, array)


A table must have a primary key to uniquely identify rows.

You can apply constraints to columns...
a UNIQUE constraint means all values in a column must be unique
the NOT NULL constraint means the column cannot be left blank (by default it can)

the serial datatype in postgres automatically gives each row an integer value.
