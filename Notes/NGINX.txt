# see NGINX.PNG

This is a middle man to relay requests between the end user and gunicorn. Its actually a high performance web server hosted on the Ubuntu VM.
The reason for using this is that it can handle SSL termination. 
Our API is designed to handle HTTP requests, not HTTPS requests. The NGINX server can convert the HTTPS request into a HTTP packet for our API (This imporves performacnce of our API). This saves us having to code HTTPS handling ourselves.

{
    "SSL termination refers to the process of decrypting encrypted traffic before passing it along to a web server." NGINX does this.
}
{
    "In a Nutshell. HTTPS is HTTP with encryption. The difference between the two protocols is that HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses. As a result, HTTPS is far more secure than HTTP"
