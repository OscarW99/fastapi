Dockerhub is for Docker what GitHub is to Git. We can track chnages in our images.

# login to docker
docker login

# rename image to comply with dockerhub naming convention
docker image tag fastapi_api oscarw99/fastapi

# use docker push to push image to docker hub... (default tag is latest)
docker push oscarw99/fastapi
