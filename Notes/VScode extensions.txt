To change settings of a VScode extension...
Just spent an hour trying to work this out so am making a note for future
You go to settings and type in the extension. You then click 'edit in json'. 
If the setting you need is not in the json dict then you need to add a new key value pair.
This may be done by autocomplete when you type in the setting as the key (as string).
If not, click on 'copy settings as json', paste this into a new file, this should have the setting you want.
Make changes and then paste this back into the main json and save. Restart vscode for changes to take effect.
