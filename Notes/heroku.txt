# Heroku tutorial: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python#deploy-the-app

heroku login
# the app name must be golbally unique
heruko create 'name_of_app'

# I've been struggling with Heroku the last couple days. I think it could be somthing to do with system administrator privalleges. I will try to run the heroku tutorial online and if that doesn't work I will ask for help online.

#.. Ok so the tutorial works fine which is strange... I'll keep probing.

use 'heroku buildpacks' to check buildpacks

use 'heroku logs' to troubleshoot problems


HAHAHAHAHAHAHA - ok so after 2 days stuck on this I realised I misspelt requirements.txt. Its now working. Oh well, this happens sometimes.

You only get a certain number of builds on the heroku free tier. You can reset this using 'heroku restart'.

We need to tell heroku to run the uvicorn app.main:app command so it knows how to run our app. We do this in a Procfile

As we do not check our .env file into git (we hide it in .gitignore), heroku runs into a problem with the config.py file and defining these variables.

heroku gives access to a free postgres instance. We create a database with the following command...
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
... look in: settings -> database credentials to see what the environment variable replacements are. 

... copy these into 'config vars' in the settings of app (on heroku platform)
then restart the app with 'heroku ps:restart'

'heroku apps:info fastapi-oscar' will remind me of the apps URL

# todo
As heroku has created a fresh posgres instance we nee to run one command to create our database...
